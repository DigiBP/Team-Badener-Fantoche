### Topic: Clinical Laboratories

### Abstract:
This project will focus on the automation and service optimisation of the clinical laboratory. Receiving patient samples from the customer (i.e. a doctor) and providing the results in a report will be the primary service of our model. We will also integrate supporting processes such as invoicing, testing and sample handling.
